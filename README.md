# Advent of Code 2025
New Year is approaching! And with that, we are happy to lock in for a new, 2025 Advent of Code


[Advent of Code official website](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Idea
This year we want to unite Computer Science societies across all London unis for an ultimate competition. 

Main idea is to create a leaderboard and a discord channel for a vibrant community of developers. We will keep the challenge discussion and potentially solutions to earlier puzzles in the channels. 

All technical societies are welcome to join us.

### Improvements we can add
- **End of Competition Social** on Friday evening the 12th or Saturday evening the 13th, to celebrate the challenge completion we can have a social with all the participants. It can be a great and vibrant networking event, brining Computer Science students from all around London.
- **Prizes**. If we involve sponsors for the event or use societies' development fund, we can have a prize pool for winners. As prizes we can set Amazon vouchers, and for a winner a cup of the best coder in London
- **Company's outreach**. It is clear we can have company's interest by sharing resuts of the competition with them, best on the leaderboard have to be London's most cracked and motivated coders. We can have some pocket change in sponsorship in return of collaborating with companies
 
This year there will be 12 Advent of Code puzzles, which ends on Friday 12th December

## How Advent of Code 2024 went
Last year we held an internal competition at City St Georges, University of London. We had about 50 participants and shared 200£ in prizes, having a nice social at the beginning of the second term

We can do so much more this year!
