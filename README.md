# Advent of Code 2025
New Year is approaching! And with that, we are happy to lock in for a new, 2025 Advent of Code


[Advent of Code official website](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Idea
This year we want to unite Computer Science societies across all London unis for an ultimate competition. The idea is to set up a common dashboard, compete altogeher, and then share prices for the winners. Pretty simple

All technical societies are welcome to join us. What do you (a cool society) need to do?
- **Advertise** the event in your channels and share the idea. We will define together details to share. It's important to spread the word as much as we can!
- As well as participants, you need to bring in either **prize money, or sponsors**. Both are needed
- **Involvement**. Altough it looks easy on the surface, there are so much more stuff we can do on top of just setting a dashboard: 
    - our own **dashboard website**. We can try fetching AOC scores if there is an API for it. Additionally, we can create a simple portal for participants where they can share their linkedin and stuff. As an alternative, just setting up a discord channel to create a vibrant community of London hackers. And we will need people to admin such a channel
    - **Prize giving**. We can do a nice social in January with prize giving and networking. The more money in - the funnier the ceremony!
- Reach out to companies. It is clear we can have company's interest by sharing resuts of the competition with them, best on the leaderboard have to be London's most cracked and motivated coders. We can have some pocket change in sponsorship in return of collaborating with companies

## How Advent of Code 2024 went
Last year we held an internal competition at City St Georges, University of London. We had about 50 participants and shared 200£ in prizes, having a nice social at the beginning of the second term

We can do so much more this year!
